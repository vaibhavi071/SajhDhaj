	1. Remove <br>, as diff device sizes affected diffrently
		Way: Added class marg-9em to provide margin
	2. Images were not set to auto, size was pixelized
		Way: Set widht to 60% in full mode and 84% in mobile mode.
		     Took care of landscape mode also
	3. Since image of category and its name and button are alternative
           One left-right, other right-left, in mobile mode, order was
	       up-down,and other down-up
			Way: Use flex order property under 746px size of device
	4. Left and right classes do not need to be absolute and left and
	   right parameter shud not be 0, otherwise in mobile mode 
           they will be in separate corners of the page, whereas they shud be in 
           mid, so we always use auto margin
